# Ecommerce App

Ecommerce App developed using MongoDB,Express,React and Node.js (MERN). 

## Features

- Users can visit the store and buy items of their choice.
- Admins can add new items as well as view the details of the orders, products and users.
- Pagination added to divide the document into discrete pages.

## Tech

This application uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
- [Node.js] -  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- [Redux] - Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state.
- [MongoDB] - MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

And of course this application itself is open source with every code available here in github.

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd ProShop
npm install
npm start
```

Simultaneously, you also need to start the client.

```sh
cd ProShop/client
npm install
```
Now you need to come back to the base folder (ProShop) and start the application. 
```sh
npm start
```
